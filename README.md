## 1. Executive Summary

The **AI‑Powered Email Summarizer** transforms raw meeting notes or emails into concise, structured summaries using an automation pipeline powered by **Make (formerly Integromat)**, **JotForm**, **Google Docs/Drive**, and an **AI summarization model**. The solution aims to:

* **Reduce manual effort** (from \~20 minutes per transcript to under 2 minutes).
* **Guarantee consistency** (standard sections: Key Decisions, Action Items, Open Questions).
* **Improve accessibility** (read‑only Google Drive links for instant sharing).
* **Scale reliably** (handle bursts with retries and batching).

This document serves as a **complete implementation and operations manual**—from design philosophy through runbooks—sized and structured to function as a 50‑page GitHub guide.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Background & Problem Statement

Teams generate large volumes of unstructured text—meeting minutes, support threads, client call notes. Converting this into actionable insights is slow, varies by writer, and often delays decision‑making. AI summarization addresses the cognitive load; automation removes the mechanical steps (copying, formatting, sending).

### 2.2 Why Workflow Automation + AI

* **Automation** orchestrates systems, eliminates swivel‑chair tasks, and enforces consistency.
* **AI** distills long passages into structured summaries with high signal‑to‑noise.
* **Combined**, they produce an auditable, scalable pipeline that improves time‑to‑insight.

### 2.3 Use Cases & Non‑Goals

**Use Cases**: recurring meeting recaps, sales call summaries, project digests, incident postmortem drafts.
**Non‑Goals**: fine‑tuned legal analysis; real‑time transcriptions; replacing human approvals where policy forbids it.

---

## 3. Project Objectives & KPIs

* **O1 — Efficiency:** 10× reduction in time per summary.
* **O2 — Quality:** >= 90% stakeholder satisfaction on clarity/usefulness.
* **O3 — Reliability:** < 0.5% failed runs/month with automated retries.
* **O4 — Security:** Zero credential exposures; all links view‑only by default.
* **KPIs:** median latency, success rate, cost per summary, re‑open rate (edits requested), email deliverability.

---

## 4. Solution Overview

### 4.1 Narrative Walkthrough

1. A user submits text or a file via **JotForm**.
2. **Make** picks up the submission, normalizes content, and calls the **AI** for a structured summary.
3. A new **Google Doc** is created with the summary and metadata.
4. The document is stored in **Google Drive**, and a **view‑only** link is generated.
5. An **email** is sent back to the submitter containing the link and optional inline highlights.

### 4.2 System Context Diagram

### 4.3 Data Flow

* **Inputs:** text, PDF, DOCX (extracted to text).
* **Processing:** normalization → prompt engineering → summarization → post‑processing (formatting, headings, bullets).
* **Outputs:** Google Doc, Drive link, email notification, optional PDF.

---

## 5. Architecture & Design

### 5.1 Make Scenario Topology

* **Trigger:** JotForm — Watch Submissions.
* **Branch A:** Text cleanup & language detection.
* **Branch B:** File download → OCR (optional) → text extraction.
* **AI Call:** HTTP/AI module with prompt templates & guardrails.
* **Persist:** Google Docs — Create Document.
* **Share:** Google Drive — Share File (link: Viewer).
* **Notify:** Email — Send.

### 5.2 Modules & Configuration

**JotForm**

* Endpoint: `Watch Submissions`
* Polling/instant: prefer **webhook** for low latency.

**Text Normalization**

* Replace smart quotes, collapse whitespace, strip headers/footers via regex (see Appendix B).
* Truncate or chunk >N tokens.

**AI Summarization**

* Endpoint: HTTP POST to AI provider.
* Timeout: 60–120 s; Retries: 2–3 with backoff.
* Response: JSON with `decisions`, `actions`, `open_questions`, `summary_text`.

**Google Docs**

* Template Doc ID (optional) for consistent branding.
* Fields: Title = `Summary – {{submission_id}} – {{date}}`.

**Google Drive**

* Scope: least privilege; designate `SUMMARIES_ROOT_FOLDER_ID`.
* Share setting: Anyone with link — Viewer.

**Email**

* Subject: `Your Summary – {{date}}`
* Body: brief highlights + Drive link.

### 5.3 Data Contracts & Schemas

{
  "submission_id": "string",
  "submitted_at": "ISO-8601",
  "submitter_email": "string",
  "source_language": "en|es|...",
  "input_text": "string",
  "ai": {
    "model": "string",
    "prompt_version": "v1.3",
    "tokens_input": 1234,
    "tokens_output": 350
  },
  "summary": {
    "decisions": ["..."],
    "actions": [{"owner":"string","task":"string","due":"YYYY-MM-DD"}],
    "open_questions": ["..."],
    "executive_summary": "string"
  },
  "artifacts": {
    "doc_id": "string",
    "drive_link": "url",
    "email_message_id": "string"
  }
}
```

### 5.4 Idempotency, Retries, & Deduplication

* **Idempotency Key:** `submission_id` used throughout.
* **Retries:** exponential backoff (2s, 8s, 30s) for network and 5xx errors.
* **Dedup:** discard replays with identical `submission_id` and checksum.

### 5.5 Environments (Dev/Test/Prod)

* Separate API keys, Drive folders, and From‑addresses.
* Feature flags for experimental prompts.

---

## 6. Detailed Implementation Guide

### 6.1 JotForm: Form Design

* **Fields:** email, title, transcript (textarea), optional file upload.
* **Validation:** email required, max file size, accepted types.
* **Webhook:** configure to Make’s custom webhook (preferred) or use Watch Submissions polling.
* **Test Link:** [https://submit.jotform.com/252246740365457](https://submit.jotform.com/252246740365457)

**Recommended Field Names**

* `submitter_email`
* `meeting_title`
* `transcript_text`
* `transcript_file`

### 6.2 Make: Trigger — Watch Submissions

* **Module:** JotForm → Watch Submissions.
* **Output Mapping:** capture submission ID, email, text/file fields.
* **Time Window:** prevent backfills from overwhelming the pipeline.



# 6.3 Make: Processing Incoming Data

Once the trigger detects a new submission, Make processes the payload received from JotForm. The payload typically contains:

* Submission ID
* Submission timestamp
* Submitter details (name, email)
* Transcript text field

**Steps:**

1. Map the transcript field into a variable for later AI processing.
2. Store metadata (name, date, submission ID) for file naming and reference.
3. Validate the input to ensure that transcript text is not empty.

---

# 6.4 AI Processing Module

The core of the workflow lies in the AI summarization process.

**Workflow:**

* Input: Transcript text
* Process: Send text to AI summarization model (e.g., OpenAI API)
* Output: Concise structured summary

**Prompt Example:**

```
You are an AI meeting assistant. Summarize the following transcript into:
1. Key points
2. Action items
3. Decisions made

Transcript: {{transcript_text}}
```

**Error Handling:**

* If text length exceeds API limits, split into chunks.
* Retry failed requests up to 3 times.

---

# 6.5 Google Drive Integration

After AI generates the summary, Make routes the content into Google Drive.

**Steps:**

1. Create a Google Doc file in the designated folder.
2. File naming convention: `MeetingSummary_{{date}}_{{name}}.docx`
3. Insert summary sections (Key points, Actions, Decisions).

**Folder Access:**

* Summaries stored in: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1juyjDJTr8aL0sWwgG932bwcNe2df4GKl)
* Permissions: Read-only for general viewers.

---

# 6.6 Email Notification (Optional)

For enhanced usability, Make can send confirmation emails.

**Steps:**

1. Collect submitter’s email from JotForm.
2. Send email with subject line: `Your Meeting Summary is Ready`
3. Include:

   * Direct Google Drive file link
   * Key points preview

**Fallback:**

* If email fails, user can still access shared Drive.

---

# 6.7 Error Handling in Make

Common error routes configured:

* **Empty Transcript:** Stop execution and log error.
* **AI Timeout:** Retry 3 times before failing.
* **Drive Upload Fail:** Store summary in backup text file within Make’s storage.

---

# 6.8 Optional Enhancements

Potential improvements to scale workflow:

* **Language Detection**: Automatically detect transcript language and translate before summarization.
* **Multi-format Export**: Store summary as PDF and Word in addition to Google Docs.
* **Slack/Teams Integration**: Send summaries directly into team channels.
* **Feedback Loop**: Add Google Form for users to rate summary accuracy.
